# SECURE-WEB-APPLICATION-WITH-TRACKING-AND-VICTIM-INTRUSION
When managing a website, it’s important to stay on top of the most critical security 
risks and vulnerabilities. Websites are most vulnerable to intrusions since anyone 
with internet access can access the websites and exploit it’s vulnerabilities as a 
software product. Here in this project I would be comparing and contrasting the top 
vulnerabilities provided by owasp. In this project penetration testing is done 
manually and using tools. I have also contrasted the prevention mechanisms for the 
mentioned vulnerabilities. In this project secure web application has been built with 
secure coding practices and intrusion prevention mechanism which prevents most of 
the vulnerabilities.
